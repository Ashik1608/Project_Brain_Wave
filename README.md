# Project_Brain_Wave

The proposed web-based application is a social networking site that enables innovators to
upload their projects and start-up ideas and connect with potential investors. The
platform provides a news feed that displays the latest projects and ideas uploaded by
innovators. Investors can browse the news feed and view the projects that interest them.
They can also view the innovator's profile, which includes information about their
background and previous projects.

The platform enables investors to contribute to the projects by investing money in
exchange for shares in the project deployment. Innovators can set the amount of money
they need to fund their project and the percentage of shares they are willing to offer in
return. Investors can choose to invest in a particular project by clicking on the "invest"
button and specifying the amount of money they want to invest. The platform will then
automatically calculate the number of shares they will receive in return.

The platform also includes a messaging system that enables innovators and investors to
communicate with each other. Innovators can use this system to provide investors with
updates on their project's progress and answer any questions they may have. Investors
can use the messaging system to ask for more information about a particular project or to
negotiate the terms of their investment.

To ensure the quality of the projects uploaded to the platform, we will implement a
review process where a team of experts will evaluate each project before it is made
available on the news feed. The experts will assess the project's feasibility, potential for
success, and the innovator's qualifications.
